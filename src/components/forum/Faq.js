    A: No, we only work with partners or local communities who own the Food
    Ladder system for their benefit. We work alongside them for a period of time
    to assist with the day-to-day running of the site. Upon a mutually agreed
    time we leave the communities and allow them to flourish.

    A: Yes, as we prefer to keep our team small and feel that we have the
    greatest impact when we work with local partners who are on the ground and
    can help fulfil our mission of minimising food insecurity.

    A: No, Food Ladder is a series of technologies and innovative growing
    practices, which create the optimal conditions for growing vegetables in
    what would otherwise be very hostile conditions. Each country, in which Food
    Ladder works, has a different set of challenges and requirements to ensure
    growing is optimised and economic outcomes are assured.

const text_4 = (
  <p style={{ paddingLeft: 24 }}>
    A: The model is whatever the on-ground partner and community decides is best
    for the local people. We like to think that there is a blend between selling
    produce to establish a financially sustainable business and providing local
    nutritious food and employment to the community itself. Ultimately it is
    their decision.

    A: Help is always appreciated. Focused volunteering is the most useful and
    so far it has led to two employment opportunities with Food Ladder. There
    are opportunities to work with us around the world, if youâ€™re interested
    please visit our Contact page.
